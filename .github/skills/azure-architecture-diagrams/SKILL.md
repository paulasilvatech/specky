# Azure Architecture Diagrams

Build complete architecture diagrams with the **official Azure, Microsoft, and GitHub icons**, delivered as editable `.drawio` files plus exported SVG. This skill provides the icon catalogs, the file format, the layout conventions, and a draw.io MCP server that creates and edits diagrams programmatically.

> Respect icon terms of use. Azure and Microsoft icons may be used to depict their products in architecture diagrams and must not be modified or re-colored. GitHub Octicons are MIT licensed; the GitHub logos follow the GitHub brand guidelines. See [references/icon-catalogs.md](references/icon-catalogs.md).

## What this skill produces

- **`.drawio` source** (editable in draw.io / diagrams.net and the VS Code extension).
- **Exported SVG** for embedding in Markdown and the paulasilva-ms documents and decks.
- Diagrams that use official vendor shapes, with consistent layout, grouping, and connector routing.

## Diagram set for an AI-native system

Produce these four as the default set (add others as needed):

1. **System context**: actors (users, GitHub Copilot, GitHub Actions) and the system boundary.
2. **Component**: agent runtime, model router, cache and memory, retrieval, tools and MCP, gateway, guardrails, observability.
3. **Deployment**: subscriptions, resource groups, VNets, private endpoints, regions.
4. **Sequence or data and control flow**: the critical path of one agent run, including cache hit and miss.

## Two ways to build

### A. Draw.io MCP server (preferred, programmatic)

A bundled Python MCP server creates and edits `.drawio` files through tools: create a diagram, add a node with an official icon, connect nodes, group, auto-lay out, and export. Register it with your MCP host and drive it from the agent. See [references/drawio-mcp.md](references/drawio-mcp.md) and the server at [scripts/drawio_mcp_server.py](scripts/drawio_mcp_server.py).

### B. Hand-authored mxGraph XML

For precise control, write the `.drawio` mxGraph XML directly using the icon styles. See [references/drawio-format.md](references/drawio-format.md).

For hand-crafted, non-icon SVG (quadrants, charts, bespoke infographics), use the `svg-professional` skill instead.

## Icon sources (official only)

- **Azure architecture icons**: the official downloadable SVG set. draw.io also ships an Azure shape library.
- **Microsoft product icons**: official sets for Microsoft 365, Entra, Power Platform, and more.
- **GitHub Octicons and logos**: Octicons (MIT) for GitHub UI marks; the GitHub mark and wordmark per brand guidelines.

Catalog details, download locations, and the draw.io shape style strings are in [references/icon-catalogs.md](references/icon-catalogs.md).

## Layout conventions

- Left to right or top to bottom flow; keep the primary path on one axis.
- Group by boundary (subscription, resource group, VNet, trust zone) with labeled containers.
- Orthogonal connectors, no crossings where avoidable, labels on edges for protocols.
- One accent color per boundary; do not re-color official product icons.
- Apply the paulasilva-ms palette to containers, labels, and connectors, never to the vendor icons themselves.

## Workflow

1. Take the service map from the design (from `ai-native-engineer` or `agentic-architecture-patterns`).
2. Choose the diagram types to produce.
3. Build with the draw.io MCP (preferred) or hand-authored XML, placing official icons for each service.
4. Lay out, group by boundary, route connectors, and label.
5. Export SVG and embed it; keep the `.drawio` source under `output/`.
6. Run `scripts/validate_drawio.py` on the `.drawio` source, then verify the diagram opens and every icon resolves.
7. Walk `references/first-run-checklist.md` before delivery.
